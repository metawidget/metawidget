		<h3>Case Study: Telef&oacute;nica Health Portal</h3>
		<h4>24th July 2011</h4>

		<p>
			This <a href="http://metawidget.org/media/whitepaper/MetawidgetWhitePaper-TelefonicaHealthPortal.pdf">white paper</a>
			presents a case study of using Metawidget to provide automatic UI generation for the
			Telef&oacutenica Health Portal system. The Health Portal is a Web-based application designed around a Service
			Oriented Architecture and built using Google Web Toolkit. It serves the Spanish National Health System and
			is deployed to some 3,000 hospitals and health clinics across Spain. The integration of Metawidget allowed
			Telef&oacutenica to reduce development and ongoing maintenance costs. It further allowed the Health Portal to
			offer a level of flexibility and functionality not possible in previous products.

		<h3>Metawidget @ JavaOne 2011</h3>
		<h4>12th July 2011</h4>
		
		<p>
			Metawidget has been accepted for a technical session at <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone">JavaOne 2011</a>
			(October 2nd-6th, San Francisco):
		</p>
		
		<h5>DRY UIs: Let the metadata do the work</h5>
		
		<p>
			How many times have you sat in a dark office after hours hand editing forms, page after page? Software
			teams spend a lot of time developing the UI. To speed up the process, developers resort to drag-and-drop
			widget solutions or model-based static generation tools. These approaches only change the appearance
			of the problem.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This talk presents Metawidget as a solution to keep your UIs DRY. Metawidget is a smart UI processor
			that populates itself, at runtime, with UI components that match properties of your model. Rather than
			introduce new technologies, it reads existing metadata (e.g. JavaBeans, annotations, XML) to create
			native UI widgets (e.g. JSF, Android, Swing).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Stop hand-coding your forms! Come learn how to break out of the rut!
